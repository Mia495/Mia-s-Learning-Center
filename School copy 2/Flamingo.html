        <h3> 
            A flamingo is a pink coloured bird that survives on an 
          <br>omnivore diet, which means they eat both plants and 
          <br>meat. Their vibrancy and type of colour can actually 
          <br>depend on the foods they eat. They obtain their pink 
          <br>colour by eating an organic pigment called carotenoid, 
          <br>in which they get from eating brine shrimp.
