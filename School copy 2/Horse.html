        <h3> 
            Horses are large and very strong. A typical domesticated horse stands 5 feet 
            <br>tall at the shoulder. It weighs about 1,150 pounds. A horse's legs are 
            <br>strong even though they look very slender.Horses have oval-shaped hooves, 
            <br>long tails, short hair, long slender legs, muscular and deep torso build, 
            <br>long thick necks, and large elongated heads. The mane is a region of coarse 
            <br>hairs, which extends along the dorsal side of the neck in both domestic 
            <br>and wild species.
