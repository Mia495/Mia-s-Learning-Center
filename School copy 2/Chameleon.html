        <h3>
            Chameleons mostly live in the rain forests and deserts of Africa. 
          <br>The color of their skin helps them blend in with their habitats. 
          <br>Chameleons that hang out in trees are usually green. Those that 
          <br>live in deserts are most often brown. A chameleon's eyes can 
          <br>move in different directions at once, which helps them to see in 
          <br>both directions.
