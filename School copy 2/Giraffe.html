        <h3>
            Giraffes have a short body, but their legs and neck are very long. The coat is 
            <br>light brown with reddish brown spots. Many giraffes have two short horns 
            <br>between the ears. Giraffes have large nostrils and a good sense of smell. 
            <br>The giraffe is the tallest of all mammals. It reaches an overall height of 
            <br>18 feet or more. The legs and neck are extremely long. Giraffes are social 
            <br>animals, living in loose, open, unstable herds varying from 10 to 20 indivi-
            <br>duals, although herds of up to 70 have been observed. Giraffes feed and drink 
            <br>during the morning and evening.
