            A frog has smooth, moist skin and big, bulging eyes. Its hind legs are more than 
            <br>twice as long as its front ones. Most frogs have webbed back feet to help them 
            <br>leap and swim. Tree frogs have sticky disks on the tips of their fingers and 
            <br>toes.Frogs are amphibians, which means they're able to live on land and in 
            <br>water. They have striking characteristics, like protruding eyes, webbed feet 
            <br>and their skin is smooth and moist. Most of them live in water, but some species 
            <br>of frog live in trees or burrow down into the ground.
