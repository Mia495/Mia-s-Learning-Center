        <h3>
          Even though the eel looks like a snake, it is actually a fish. They 
          <br>have long, narrow bodies with long dorsal and anal fins. Most eels 
          <br>have no scales. The eel's backbone is made up of over 100 vertebrae 
          <br>which makes it very flexible. Eels are characterized by their elongated, 
          <br>wormlike bodies. Unlike most fish, eels do not have pelvic fins, and most 
          <br>species do not have pectoral fins. Eels have a continuous dorsal, anal, 
          <br>and caudal fin that runs around the tail tip. Eels generate waves that 
          <br>travel the length of their bodies to help them swim.
