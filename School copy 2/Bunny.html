        <h3>
            Happy bunnies practice a cute behavior known as a “binky:” 
          <br>they jump up in the air and twist and spin around! A baby bunny 
          <br>is called a kit, a female is called a doe, and a male is a buck. 
          <br>A group of rabbits is called a herd. Rabbits are herbivores, eating 
          <br>a diet entirely of grasses and other plants.
