        <h3>
            Beavers are the largest living rodents in North America, with adults averaging 40 pounds in 
          <br>weight and measuring more than 3 feet in length, including the tail. These semi-aquatic 
          <br>mammals have webbed hind feet, large incisor teeth, and a broad, flat tail. Beavers use 
          <br>these strong teeth to gnaw through trees in order to create their home.Beavers can stay 
          <br>underwater for about 6-8 minutes. Large lungs allow beavers to stay submerged for an 
          <br>extended period of time. Though their movement may be awkward on land, webbed hind feet 
          <br>and rudder-like tails help them move swiftly through the water, where they can swim up 
          <br>to 6 mph.
