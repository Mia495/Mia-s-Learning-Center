        <h3>
          Bumblebees are distinctive for their fuzzy, pile-covered bodies and 
          <br>bold colors, which helps them ward off predators. A bee's body is 
          <br>divided into three parts: a head with two antennae, a thorax with six 
          <br>legs, and an abdomen. All bees have branched hairs somewhere on 
          <br>their bodies and two pairs of wings. Unlike honeybees, they don't make 
          <br>honey, as they don't need to store food for winter. They typically live a 
          <br>year, at most. Bumblebees are among the most important pollinators.
