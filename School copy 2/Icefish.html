        <h3>
          Icefish are sometimes called crocodile icefish because of the shape of 
          <br>their snout. The color of icefish is usually white, grey, silver, black or red. 
          <br>They have transparent blood because they lack red blood cells and hemoglobin. 
          <br>Hemoblobin is a protein in the blood that transports oxygen. Icefish don't have 
          <br>swim bladders, so they spend much of their lives on the ocean bottom, although 
          <br>they also have a lighter skeleton than some other fish, which allows them to swim 
          <br>up into the water column at night to capture prey. They may be found in schools. 
          <br>Icefish eat plankton, small fish, and krill.
