        <h3>
          Goldfish are a golden-yellow or orange fish that live in fish tanks or 
          <br>human-made ponds as pets. They are freshwater fish, meaning they live 
          <br>in water that isn't salty. The reason their eyes look bulgy is because they 
          <br>don't have eyelids and can't blink, but they have great eyesight and can see 
          <br>up to 16 feet away. Goldfish hatch with dark, pigmented scales, but they 
          <br>depigment 2 to 3 months after hatching. Adult goldfish are a yellow-orange 
          <br>color and possess transparent fins. They can come in colors like red, black, 
          <br>and silver due to a variety of factors including diet, light, and illness.
