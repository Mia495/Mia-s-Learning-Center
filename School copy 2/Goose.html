        <h3> 
            Geese eat seeds, nuts, grass, plants and berries. They are known 
          <br>to be the largest waterfowls. Geese have humped bills that become 
          <br>narrower toward the tip. Their bills are good for grasping grasses, 
          <br>which is their main food. Though they are waterfowls, they spent 
          <br>most of their time on land. Geese always fly in the shape of a 'V', 
          <br>as it allows at least 71 % greater flying range.
