        <h3>
          A butterfly is a flying insect with a small body and large, often colorful 
          <br>wings. Some gardeners plant specific flowers that attract butterflies. 
          <br>Butterflies are closely related to moths, which also have wings that 
          <br>are large in proportion to their bodies and antennae. They have a long 
          <br>tongue that can uncurl like a long straw to suck up food including nectar 
          <br>and fruit juices.
