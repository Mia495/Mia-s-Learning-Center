        <h3>
          Ants are social insects and like to live in big colonies. They 
          <br>live in nests all over the world. Ants can live underground, 
          <br>in wood, plants, trees and soil. They cleverly use soil and 
          <br>plants to help make their nests. Ants have six legs and three 
          <br>main body parts: head, thorax, and abdomen. Some also have 
          <br>wings. They live together in groups called colonies, and every 
          <br>ant has a job. Ants go through metamorphosis, or changes, as 
          <br>they grow from eggs to larvae to pupae to adults.
