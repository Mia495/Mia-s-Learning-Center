            Cows are also known as cattle, and each member of a cattle 
          <br>family has its own specific name. Female cattle who have given 
          <br>birth are called cows, while female cattle who have not had a 
          <br>baby are called heifers. Male cattle are called bulls. Even baby 
          <br>cattle get a special name 'calves'.
