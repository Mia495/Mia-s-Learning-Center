        <h3>
          Dolphins are usually colored in some mixture of black, white, and gray. 
          <br>They have two flippers, or fins, on their sides, as well as a triangular 
          <br>fin on the back. A dolphin must come up to the water's surface to get 
          <br>air. It breathes through a single nostril, called a blowhole, on the top 
          <br>of its head. Dolphins have a long, slender snout with about 100 teeth, 
          <br>and a streamlined body. They can be found all over the world and in 
          <br>different environments.
