        <h3> 
            In Native American cultures, hummingbirds are revered for their 
          <br>keen sense of sight and ability to fly at great heights. The 
          <br>red-tailed hummingbird's average weight is three pounds. Females 
          <br>are about 25-percent heavier than males. hummingbirds are solitary 
          <br>birds who spend much of their time hunting for food or 
          <br>resting. As birds of prey, they eat only meat.
