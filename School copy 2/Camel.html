        <h3>
            A camel is a large animal with a long neck and one or two humps on its back, and they're 
            <br>designed to survive in extreme desert conditions. These animals come in many shades 
            <br>of brown, from cream-colored to dark brown, and a camel can be over 7 feet tall at 
            <br>its hump.They are the only land mammals capable of drinking salt water without any 
            <br>ill effects. They can drink up to fifty-seven litres of water in one go. It's a myth 
            <br>that camels store water in their humps. They have sealable nostrils, to stop the sand 
            <br>getting up their nose.
