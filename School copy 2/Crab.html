        <h3>
          A crab is a sea creature with a flat round body covered by a shell, 
          <br>and five pairs of legs with large claws on the front pair. Crabs 
          <br>usually move sideways. Crabs have a hard covering known as the 
          <br>exoskeleton. Like its relative the lobster, a crab has five pairs 
          <br>of legs. The first pair has large pinching claws that help with 
          <br>feeding and defense. The last pair may be broad and flattened 
          <br>to serve as paddles for crabs that swim.
