        <h3>
          Hammerhead sharks have a stout body and classically shark-shaped with a 
          <br>markedly tall, curved, first dorsal fin. The great hammerhead is dusky 
          <br>brown to light gray on the dorsal surface, fading to a cream-colored 
          <br>underside, with an asymmetrical caudal fin. They can reach a maximum 
          <br>length of 18 to 20 feet. Hammerhead sharks do not lay eggs like most 
          <br>other fish. Instead, they give birth to live young. Their babies are called 
          <br>pups. Young hammerhead sharks can swim as soon as they are born. 
          <br>Hammerhead sharks are carnivores, which means they only eat meat. They 
          <br>feed on stingrays but can also eat fish, crabs, squid, and lobsters.
