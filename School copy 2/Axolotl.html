        <h3>
            Axolotls are a type of salamander. Their gills appear as feathery appendages 
          <br>on the outside of their bodies. As well as gills, axolotls also develop lungs.
          <br>Axolotls are strict carnivores, meaning they only eat meat. Axolotls eat 
          <br>worms, insects, small fish, mollusks, and just about anything else that 
          <br>can fit inside their mouth and swallow whole.
