        <h3>
          Earthworms are smooth-skinned worms, with a body made of many small segments. 
          <br>If you look at the body you can see lines that mark the segments. Each segment 
          <br>has stiff little hairs that help the worm move. But, sometimes the hairs are 
          <br>hard to see. They have no skeleton, but they do have lots of muscles. Earthworms 
          <br>eat almost anything that is alive, as long as it is dead when they eat it. They 
          <br>use their skin to breathe as they do not have lungs.
