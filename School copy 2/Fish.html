        <h3>
          Fish are aquatic vertebrate animals that have gills but lack limbs with 
          <br>digits, like fingers or toes. Recall that vertebrates are animals with 
          <br>internal backbones. Most fish are streamlined in their general body form. 
          <br>Unlike mammals, fish are cold-blooded. This means that they do not maintain 
          <br>a constant internal body temperature; instead, their temperature is greatly 
          <br>influenced by their environment. True fish have a backbone and fins. Most also 
          <br>breathe with gills and have scales that cover their bodies.
