        <h3>
            The jaguar looks much like the leopard. But the jaguar is larger and has 
            <br>bigger black spots. The average jaguar is between 5 and 6 feet long, 
            <br>not including the tail. Males weigh between 220 and 350 pounds. Some 
            <br>jaguars are so dark they don't seem to have spots. Unlike many other 
            <br>cats, jaguars do not avoid water; in fact, they are quite good swimmers.
            <br>They are creative hunters that can hunt their prey in various ways. 
            <br>They can pounce on them in the treetops or even in the water. In contrast 
            <br>to most cats, they are not afraid of the water and fare quite well.
