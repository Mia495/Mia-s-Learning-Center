        <h3>
          Japanese beetles are about 10 millimeters long. They are a shiny metallic 
          <br>green with copper brown wings and six small patches of white hairs along 
          <br>the sides and back of the body. Adult beetles feed on the flowers, fruit, 
          <br>and foliage of plants. Japanese beetles are pests of turfgrass. They chew 
          <br>on grass roots, causing the turf to wither and die. Males and females look 
          <br>alike except the males are a little smaller.
