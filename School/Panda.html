        <h3> 
            The panda has a bulky body and a round head. Its fur is white 
            <br>with black on the shoulders, legs, and ears and around the 
            <br>eyes. Males grow to about 5 feet tall and weigh about 220 
            <br>pounds. Females are usually smaller. Pandas have excellent 
            <br>camouflage for their habitat. Their eyes are different to 
            <br>other bears. The baby pandas, called cubs, are well protected 
            <br>in their first month. Pandas can swim and even climb trees. 
            <br>They spend a lot of their day eating bamboo. Bamboo is critical 
            <br>to their diet.
