        <h3> 
            Rhinoceroses are large, heavy animals with thick gray or brown 
            <br>skin, short legs, and one or two horns on their nose. They 
            <br>are herbivores and only eat plants. Rhinoceroses are endangered, 
            <br>meaning there are very few left, because they have been hunted 
            <br>for the horns on their nose. Rhinoceroses are universally recognized 
            <br>by their massive bodies, stumpy legs and either one or two dermal 
            <br>horns. In some species, the horns may be short or not obvious. 
            <br>They are renowned for having poor eyesight, but their senses of 
            <br>smell and hearing are well developed.
