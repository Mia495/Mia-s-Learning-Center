        <h3>
            A pufferfish is a fish that is usually poisonous, normally lives in warm ocean waters 
            <br>and can blow up into a ball several times its regular size, and it is deadly to humans 
            <br>and some animals if eaten. They take in oxygen through special organs called gills, so 
            <br>they can breathe even when they are puffed up. Pufferfish have tough, usually prickly 
            <br>skins. The spiny puffer has long spines all over its body. When it inflates, the spines 
            <br>stick out like porcupine quills.
