        <h3>
            Owls have excellent eyesight and hearing. An owl cannot 
            <br>move its eyes much. But it can turn its head far around to 
            <br>look directly backward. Most owls eat small animals such as 
            <br>mice, voles, and rabbits. Owls have soft feathers that provide 
            <br>insulation in cold weather. Their feathers are also colored to 
            <br>help them camouflage.
