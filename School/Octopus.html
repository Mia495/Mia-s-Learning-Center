        <h3>
            Octopuses are sea animals famous for their rounded bodies, bulging eyes, and 
            <br>eight long arms. Octopus has two eyes and a beak, and they have very good 
            <br>eyesight. Octopuses are also known for their intelligence, in fact they are 
            <br>considered to be one of the most intelligent invertebrates in the world as 
            <br>they demonstrate many behaviours. Octopuses will sometimes hunt with 
            <br>other animals, usually fish. Octopuses are so smart that if they are kept 
            <br>in an aquarium they will sometimes learn how to escape, and they will 
            <br>sometimes use this knowledge to free other octopuses.
