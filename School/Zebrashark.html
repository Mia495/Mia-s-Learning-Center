        <h3>
            Zebra shark, the common name of these slow-swimming, non-aggressive, bottom-
            <br>dwelling sharks, is derived from their juvenile coloration: narrow bars reminiscent 
            <br>of a zebra's stripes. When the sharks grow into adults, the bars become spots. 
            <br>Their common name in Australia is leopard shark. Zebra sharks reach a maximum 
            <br>length of about 8 feet and live over 28 years in aquaria. Zebra sharks are often 
            <br>confused with leopard sharks because they are born dark brown with white bars 
            <br>across their bodies, but become light yellow with small dark spots as they mature.
