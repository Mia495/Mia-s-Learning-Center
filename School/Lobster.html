        <h3>
            Lobsters are animals that live in all of the world's oceans. They are 
            <br>invertebrates, which means they have no backbone, but they do have 
            <br>an exoskeleton to help protect their inside body parts. Lobsters have 
            <br>two big claws and eight walking legs. One claw is the crusher claw, 
            <br>which helps the lobster destroy something he wants to eat. The other 
            <br>claw is called the pincher or ripper claw and is used to tear food apart.
            <br>They eat both plants and animals. Many people eat lobster for food.
