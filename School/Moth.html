        <h3>
            The moth is easily recognised by the round-tipped forewing, with
            <br>large, rounded, pale-outlined oval and kidney mark and uniformly 
            <br>grey hindwing. Their markings are a shade of brown or grey. This moth 
            <br>is the only one of its kind in its genus here in North America. Green 
            <br>caterpillars eat from a variety of plants. Ash, birch, crabapple, maple, 
            <br>and oak leaves are abundant food sources. Grape leaves also make a 
            <br>good host plant.
