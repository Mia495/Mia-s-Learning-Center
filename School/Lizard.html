        <h3>
            Lizards usually have a long tail, too. Most lizards have dry scales 
            <br>covering their body. The scales are small plates that are either 
            <br>smooth or bumpy. Lizards are distinguished from snakes by the 
            <br>possession of legs, movable eyelids, and external ear openings. 
            <br>However, some traditional lizards lack one or more of these 
            <br>features.Many lizards use camouflage to escape predators and hunt 
            <br>for food. Many lizards are born with skin that matches the colors 
            <br>of places they live. Other lizards, like chameleons and geckos, 
            <br>can change the color of their skin to blend in with their surroundings.
