        <h3>
            Newts look a lot like frogs, but also like fish. Newts have both 
            <br>legs and tails on their bodies. A newt is a small, brightly 
            <br>colored amphibian that spends part of its time on land and 
            <br>the rest in the water. A newt looks like a cross between a 
            <br>frog and a lizard. Newts are a type of salamander that primarily 
            <br>lives on land but also has gills that enable it to occasionally 
            <br>live an aquatic life. The newt has a long, slender body with a 
            <br>laterally flattened tail. The largest European type grows to about 
            <br>7 inches in length. The largest American type, the California 
            <br>newt, reaches about 6 inches.
