        <h3>
            A ray is a fish with a flattened body and large, winglike 
            <br>fins. Rays belong to the same large group of fishes as sharks.
            <br>They are related to sharks, and like their shark cousins, they 
            <br>do not have bones. Instead, their bodies are supported by 
            <br>cartilage; the same material that you feel inside the tip of 
            <br>your nose. Stingrays have broad fins that run the full length 
            <br>of their bodies, giving them a flat, roundish shape.
