        <h3>
            The peacock is the most exquisite bird in the world because 
            <br>of its vibrant feathers and colour. The peacock spreads out 
            <br>its colorful feathers like a fan to attract female peacocks, 
            <br>also known as peahens. Peahens are usually a brown-ish color 
            <br>with white bellies. Peacocks do not lay eggs, but peahens do. 
            <br>A peahen's eggs are usually white with some dark spots.
