        <h3>
            Pelicans are among the largest flying birds. They are famous 
            <br>for their huge throat pouches. A pelican uses its pouch and 
            <br>its very long bill to scoop up fish. The color of pelicans depends 
            <br>on the species, but they all have short legs, webbed feet, and 
            <br>large wings. Pelicans live around lakes, rivers, and seacoasts in 
            <br>many parts of the world.
