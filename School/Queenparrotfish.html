        <h3>
            Male queen parrotfish are blue with green, red, and orange markings. 
            <br>Female queen parrot fish are reddish or purplish with a white stripe. 
            <br>The largest parrot fish grow to about 4 feet long. They may weigh about 
            <br>45 pounds. Other types are half that size. The name "parrotfish" is 
            <br>derived from their fused teeth, which bear close resemblance to a bird's 
            <br>beak. Their teeth are specialized for scraping algae and invertebrates from 
            <br>coral and rocks. Another set of teeth, are located on the floor and roof 
            <br>of their throats.
