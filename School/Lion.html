        <h3>
            The lion is the largest member of the cat family. Female lions 
          <br>are the main hunters. While they're out looking for food, the 
          <br>males guard the pride's territory and their young. A lion's roar 
          <br>can be heard up to eight kilometres away. The lion has a long 
          <br>body, short legs, sharp claws, and a large head. Adult males 
          <br>are about 9 to 10 feet long, including the tail. They stand about 
          <br>3 feet tall at the shoulder and can weigh 370 to 500 pounds.
