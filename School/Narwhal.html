        <h3>
            The narwhal is a medium-sized toothed whale that has a large tusk, protruding 
            <br>from a canine tooth. These warm-blooded, air-breathing mammals, are often 
            <br>nicknamed the 'unicorn of the sea' because of the tusk. Some narwhals can 
            <br>even have two tusks, while others don't have one at all. A narwhal's tusk 
            <br>can be up to 9 feet long and weigh more than 22 pounds. Narwhal can dive 
            <br>really deep into the ocean. They are one of the deepest diving sea mammals. 
            <br>They can dive up to 5,000 feet deep. Narwhals can live to be 50 years old.
