        <h3>
          Jellyfish are sea animals with a soft, jellylike body and no bones. They 
          <br>have tentacles that they use to sting their prey. Sometimes they sting 
          <br>swimming people, too. Jellyfish are related to corals and sea anemones. 
          <br>Some jellyfish can glow in the dark. They are the oldest multi-organ animal. 
          <br>Theyc can be found all over the world. Some jellyfish are immortal. There is 
          <br>even a giant jellyfish called the hair jelly. Over 150 million people are stung 
          <br>by jellyfish each year.
