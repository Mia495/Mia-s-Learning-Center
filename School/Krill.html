        <h3>
            Krill look like smaller versions of familiar crustaceans such as 
            <br>prawns or lobsters. Krill are mostly transparent, although their 
            <br>shells have a bright red tinge from small pigment spots. Their 
            <br>digestive system is usually visible and is often a vivid green from 
            <br>the microscopic plants they have eaten. Their body is almost 
            <br>see-through, with small, reddish spots. Krill have many legs, which 
            <br>they use for swimming and gathering food. Most krill have special 
            <br>organs, or body parts, on their underside that give off light. This 
            <br>makes them visible at night.
