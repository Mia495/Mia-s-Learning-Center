        <h3>
          Katydids have large hind legs and are distinguished by their extremely 
          <br>long, threadlike antennae. Often large and green, many katydids have 
          <br>long wings, but some common species are nearly wingless, and wing 
          <br>form and function vary widely. Katydids are medium-sized to large 
          <br>insects. They are usually green, sometimes with brown markings. They 
          <br>have a thick body, usually taller than it is wide, and long thing legs. 
          <br>The hind legs are longer than the front or middle legs, and are often 
          <br>used for jumping.
