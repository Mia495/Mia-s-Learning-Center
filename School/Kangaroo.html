        <h3>
            Kangaroos have short, soft furry coats. Their front paws are quite short 
            <br>and small, but they have large and powerful hind legs. They have long 
            <br>faces and large ears, and a very long tail that helps them balance when 
            <br>leaping long distances. Kangaroos are animals that get around by hopping 
            <br>on their back legs. They belong to a group of animals called marsupials. 
            <br>Kangaroos eat mostly grasses, although they will eat other plants. These 
            <br>animals can carry their babies, called joeys, in a pouch.
