        <h3>
            Parrots are colorful birds that have large, hooked beaks, and 
            <br>some are known to copy the way people talk. There are more 
            <br>than 350 different kinds of parrots, but they all have some 
            <br>things in common with each other. Parrots can get very old 
            <br>and usually live to be around 60.
