        <h3>
          Roaches are flattened, brownish, fast-running insects, with long, slender 
          <br>antennae. There are three life stages: egg, nymph, and adult. The female 
          <br>roach produces small, brown, bean-shaped egg cases that are deposited 
          <br>in out-of-the-way places. Roaches are bugs that have lived on Earth for 
          <br>more than 320 million years. There are more than 3,500 different species, 
          <br>or types, of roach. Most live in forests in warm areas. However, some roaches 
          <br>live in warm, dark areas of houses, apartment and office buildings, airplanes, 
          <br>and ships.
