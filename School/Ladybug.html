        <h3>
          Ladybugs are small and usually quite round in shape. The color on the wing 
          <br>covers can be yellow, orange, or red and often has small black dots on it. 
          <br>Some species are solid black. Ladybugs also have black legs, head, and 
          <br>antennae. Their spots act as a warning for predators. When prey is in short 
          <br>supply, female ladybugs may eat their own eggs which they've laid. Ladybugs 
          <br>can lay up to 1,000 eggs in one season. They have tiny wings underneath their 
          <br>red shell, which are used to fly.
