        <h3>
            Ostriches are flightless birds with a long, bare neck, long, sturdy 
            <br>legs and a bulky body covered with feathers. Males and females 
            <br>have different coloured feathers. Males have black plumage with 
            <br>a white tail, and females are mostly brown. They have two strong 
            <br>legs that were made for speed and can run about 31 miles per hour 
            <br>for a long time. If they're in a hurry, they can run short distances 
            <br>up to 43 miles per hour. They will run from a predator, but they 
            <br>can also fight with their powerful legs.
