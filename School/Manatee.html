        <h3>
            Manatees are gentle animals. They rarely fight, and they have no natural 
            <br>enemies. Subsisting on water plants and plants that grow at the water's 
            <br>edge, a manatee takes in up to 1 pound of food for every 10 pounds it 
            <br>weighs. Adult manatees are typically 9 to 10 feet long from snout to tail 
            <br>and weigh around 1,000 pounds. However, they may grow to over 13 feet 
            <br>long and weigh more than 3,500 pounds. Manatees have two fore limb 
            <br>flippers that they use for steering movements and to hold vegetation while 
            <br>eating.
