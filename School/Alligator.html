        <h3>
          An alligator is a large reptile with short legs. While crocodiles have a shorter and rounder
          <br>snout, alligators have a pointier snout. The two extant species are the American alligator and
          <br>the Chinese alligator. Several extinct species of alligator are known from fossil remains.
          <br>Reptiles are cold-blooded animals that lay eggs and are covered in scales or hard plates. 
          <br>Alligators are no reptile runts. They can grow up to 15 feet long and weigh about 1,000 pounds. 
          <br>A gator's coat is rough and scaled. The young alligators are black with bright yellow blotches and 
          <br>stripes, and the adults are a uniform dark color.
