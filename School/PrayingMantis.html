        <h3>
            The praying mantis gets its name because they have very long front legs 
            <br>that they hold in a position that reminds people of praying. Praying 
            <br>mantises will eat just about anything they can catch including insects, 
            <br>birds, and fish. Praying mantises are carnivores, meaning that they 
            <br>eat other animals. Praying Mantises are found on every continent of 
            <br>the world except Antarctica. They are mostly found in tropical and 
            <br>subtropical regions. They thrive in areas with mild winters and 
            <br>sufficient vegetation. This includes rainforests, grasslands, meadows, 
            <br>and even deserts.
