        <h3>
          A mosquito has a soft body with a hard covering called an exoskeleton. It has 
          <br>two narrow wings, two antennas, and six long legs. A female mosquito usually 
          <br>has a mouthpart called a proboscis, which looks like a long tube. She uses her 
          <br>proboscis to pierce skin and suck blood from animals.Mosquitoes can't focus 
          <br>their eyes like people. Instead, their eyes stay open to help them detect quick 
          <br>movements. The mosquito's wings beat about 1,000 times per second and 
          <br>create the insect's telltale buzzing sound. The female's wings create a higher-
          <br>pitched tone than the male's, helping it attract potential mates.
