        <h3>
            Monkeys are small or medium-sized primates that typically have long 
            <br>tails. There are more than 260 types of monkeys all over the globe, 
            <br>in different sizes, shapes and colours. These mammals are really 
            <br>intelligent and have opposable thumbs, which makes them similar to 
            <br>humans. Monkeys are intelligent animals that are good at solving 
            <br>problems. Almost all types live together in groups. A monkey group 
            <br>commonly includes several related females, their young, and one or 
            <br>more males. Monkeys use facial expressions, body movements, and 
            <br>various noises to communicate with each other.
