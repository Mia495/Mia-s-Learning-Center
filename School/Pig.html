        <h3>
            Pigs are gentle creatures with surprising intelligence. Studies 
          <br>have found they're smarter than dogs and even 3-year-old 
          <br>children! In the wild, pigs form small groups that typically 
          <br>include a few sows and their piglets.Their intelligence is higher 
          <br>than a dog's, some primates and even young human children. 
          <br>They are much more tolerant of colder temperatures than heat.
