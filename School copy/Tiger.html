        <h3> 
            Tigers are the largest of the world's big cats. Male tigers 
            <br>can weigh up to 300 kilograms and measure nearly 13 feet 
            <br>in length. Females are smaller, weighing a maximum of 170 
            <br>kilograms and measuring between 6 and 9 feet in length. 
            <br>They are excellent hunters and are considered to be an apex 
            <br>predator. Tigers are powerful hunters with sharp teeth, strong 
            <br>jaws and agile bodies. They are the largest terrestrial mammal 
            <br>whose diet consists entirely of meat. The tiger's closest 
            <br>relative is the lion. In fact, without fur, it is difficult to 
            <br>distinguish a tiger from a lion.
