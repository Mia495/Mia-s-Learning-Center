        <h3>
            Sheep are basically timid animals who tend to graze in flocks 
          <br>and are almost totally lacking in protection from predators. 
          <br>They mature at about one year of age, and many breed when 
          <br>they reach the age of about one and a half years. Most births 
          <br>are single, although sheep do have twins on occasion.
