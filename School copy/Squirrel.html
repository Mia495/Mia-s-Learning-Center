        <h3>
            Squirrels are rodents that have long bushy tails. Squirrels are generally 
            <br>small rodents with slender bodies, bushy tails and large eyes. In general, 
            <br>their fur is short, soft and silky, and ranges in thickness from species to 
            <br>species. The color of their fur is also highly variable and can be whitish, 
            <br>gray, yellow, red, brown, or even black. In many cities, squirrels are 
            <br>seen more often than any other wild mammal. The squirrel family 
            <br>also includes groundhogs, prairie dogs, and chipmunks. There are 
            <br>more than 250 different animals in the family.
