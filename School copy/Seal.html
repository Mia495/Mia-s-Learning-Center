        <h3>
            A seal's body is round in the middle and narrower at the ends. 
            <br>The skin is usually brown, gray, or black. The smallest seals 
            <br>are about 4 feet long and weigh about 200 pounds. The largest 
            <br>seals can be 21 feet long and weigh more than 8,000 pounds. 
            <br>Seals are semi-aquatic mammals that are in a group called pinnipeds, 
            <br>which means fin-footed. There are 32 species of web-footed aquatic 
            <br>mammals that live chiefly in cold seas and whose body shape is round 
            <br>at the middle and tapered at the ends. It is adapted for swift and 
            <br>graceful swimming.
