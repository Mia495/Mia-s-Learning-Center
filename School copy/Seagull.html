        <h3> 
            Seagulls can land on the water to feed or rest. They are 
            <br>expert food thieves. Seagulls are opportunistic feeders, 
            <br>meaning they will try almost any food they encounter. 
            <br>Seagulls can migrate, meaning that they spend different 
            <br>seasons in different places. They have incredible memories 
            <br>too, they can identify human faces and behaviours especially 
            <br>those who have previously fed them.
