        <h3>
            Snails are invertebrates, which means they do not have a 
            <br>backbone. These animals move around on a single muscly 
            <br>“foot” and carry their shell on their backs. They retreat 
            <br>inside their shells at any sign of danger. Snails do not have 
            <br>bones, but they can use their shell for protection. Snails 
            <br>are found on land and in the sea.
