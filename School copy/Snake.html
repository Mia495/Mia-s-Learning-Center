        <h3> 
            A snake is a reptile with a long, thin body but no legs. 
            <br>Some lizards are legless and look like snakes, however, 
            <br>most lizards have eyelids, and snakes do not. All snakes 
            <br>eat live prey, which is grabbed and swallowed whole 
            <br>without chewing it into pieces. Their ears are inside them 
            <br>and not outside, like ours. Snakes cannot see the way other 
            <br>animals do. The vision for most snake species is blurry. 
            <br>This is why snakes tend to rely on their other senses to 
            <br>hunt and move about.
